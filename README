PyMIR is a Python library for common tasks in Music Information Retrieval (MIR)

Prerequisites
---------------
- Numpy
- Scipy
- FFmpeg executable
- Audiolab is required for playback
 
PyMIR is divided into two main sections:
- pymir - for analyzing digital audio content
- pymir.symbolic - for analysis of high level objects within music theoretic frameworks

PyMIR
------

PyMIR consists of the following classes:

- Frame 
	- subclass of ndarray
	- used to represent time-series data

	Implemented Methods:
	
	- cqt (Constant Q Transform)
	- dct (Discrete Cosine Transform)
	- energy
	- rms (Root mean squared amplitude)
	- spectrum (Create an instance of the Spectrum class by computing an FFT of the frame)
	- zcr (Zero-crossing rate)
	
	TODO:
	
- Spectrum
	- subclass of ndarray
	- used to represent spectral data
	
	Implemented Methods:
	- chroma
	- idct (Inverse DCT)
	
	TODO:
	- bandwidth
	- centroid
	- cepstrum ?
	- crest
	- flatness
	- flux
	- kurtosis
	- ifft (Inverse FFT)
	- mfcc (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
	- rolloff
	- skewness
	- spread
	- tilt
	
- AudioFile
	- subclass of Frame
	- loads MP3 and WAV files into memory as Frames.
	
	Implemented Methods:
	- open - Static method. Opens MP3 or WAV depending on file extension
